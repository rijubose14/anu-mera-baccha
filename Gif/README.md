# Simple two-page UI

Open `index.html` in a browser. Clicking the **No** button navigates to `second.html`.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page with the question
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — behavior
- `second.html` — page shown after pressing No

Note: the avatar loads `request.gif` from this folder. The file is already present as `request.gif`.
